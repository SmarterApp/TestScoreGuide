These grade- and subject-specific documents provided by the Council of the Great City Schools can help you learn more about student expectations, including the types of learning activities students may encounter in their classroom, and what you can do to help them learn outside of school. You are also encouraged to reach out to the student’s school administration and teachers to talk about ways to help the student succeed.
