# Understanding the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) Student Score Reports

The Student Score Report includes results from the Smarter Balanced English Language Arts/Literacy and Mathematics tests, which reflect California’s rigorous academic standards. These tests include a wide range of questions and include tasks that ask students to explain how they solved problems. These tests also allow students to demonstrate analytical writing and critical thinking as well as their knowledge of facts. To learn more about these tests,
visit the California Department of Education [CAASPP Summative Assessments Web page](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/).

## Student Score Report Sample

<div class="block" markdown="1">

The following is a sample Student Score Report presented for illustrative purposes. Content differs for each grade.

(1 and 4) This portion indicates the student’s overall scores, overall statement of progress, and the corresponding achievement level for the English Language Arts/Literacy (ELA) and Mathematics tests. For grade eleven, it also provides an indication of the student’s Early Assessment Program (EAP) results. More information on the EAP is available on the back of the Student Score Report and from the [California State University Success Web page](https://www.csusuccess.org/).

(2 and 5) This portion indicates the student’s overall scores and corresponding achievement level displayed in a bar graph. The most recent result is highlighted. If the student took the Smarter Balanced tests in previous years, the student’s scores from those grades are also displayed. For example, Matthew took the tests in grades three, four, and five, so  the scores for all three years  are displayed. (Note: The Student Score Report for students in grades three and eleven only show one year of results, as these students did not take Smarter Balanced tests during the previous two years.)

(3 and 6) This portion indicates the student’s performance within a claim or area for ELA or mathematics. The results by area are for the most recent results only. These results, which provide an indication of areas of strengths and weaknesses, should be considered in light of other information about the student’s academic performance, and may be used in conversations with the student’s teachers to think about how you can work together to help the student continue on a path to success.

				</p>
				<p markdown="1">

For ELA, results are reported for the areas of Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry.

				</p>
				<p markdown="1">

For mathematics, results are reported for the areas of Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning.

				</p>
				<p markdown="1">

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

				</p>
<p markdown="1">
Also provided in this portion is the student’s score history: a side-by-side comparison of the student’s overall performance each year, in both ELA and mathematics, with the state average.
