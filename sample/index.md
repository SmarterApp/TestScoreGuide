# Understanding the Washington Comprehensive Assessment Program (WCAP) Student Score Reports

The Student Score Report includes results from the Smarter Balanced English Language Arts/Literacy and Mathematics tests, which reflect Washington’s rigorous learning standards. These tests include a wide range of questions and include tasks that ask students to explain how they solved problems. These tests also allow students to demonstrate analytical writing and critical thinking as well as their knowledge of facts. To learn more about these tests, visit the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction [Smarter Balanced Overview web page](http://www.k12.wa.us/smarter/default.aspx).

(1 and 4) This portion indicates the student’s overall score for the English Language Arts/Literacy (ELA) and Mathematics tests. It includes statements about how the student’s score compares to the average score in their school, in their district, and in the state, and a statement about the margin of error in their test score. For high school, it also provides an indication of whether the student met the college and career ready cut score and the assessment graduation requirement score.

(3 and 6) This portion indicates the student’s performance within a claim for ELA or mathematics. These results, which provide an indication of areas of strengths and weaknesses, should be considered in light of other information about the student’s academic performance, and may be used in conversations with the student’s teachers to think about how you can work together to help the student continue on a path to success.

				</p>
				<p markdown="1">
				For ELA, results are reported for the claims of Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry.

				</p>
				<p markdown="1">

				For mathematics, results are reported for the claims of Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling & Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning.

				<p markdown="1">

				If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.
