# Understanding the Oregon Individual Student Report

The Student Score Report includes results from the English language arts and Mathematics assessments, which reflect Oregon’s rigorous academic standards. These tests include a wide range of questions and include tasks that ask students to explain how they solved problems. These tests also allow students to demonstrate analytical writing and critical thinking as well as their knowledge of facts. To learn more about these tests, visit the [Oregon Department of Education Student Assessment Web page](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/assessment/).
