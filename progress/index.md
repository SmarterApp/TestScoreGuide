# Understanding Student Progress from Year to Year

To understand the student’s overall performance, consider both the score and the achievement level. Score ranges are different for each grade, and the standards for the next grade are more challenging than for the previous grade. As a result, students may need a higher overall score to remain in the same achievement level as the previous year. If the student took the English language arts/literacy and mathematics tests in the last year, the results on the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress Student Score Report allow you to look at the progress the student made over the course of the past year toward becoming college and career ready.
