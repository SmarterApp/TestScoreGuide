# Understanding Student Progress from Year to Year

To understand the studentâ€™s overall performance, consider both the score and the achievement level. Score ranges are different for each grade, and the standards for the next grade are more challenging than for the previous grade. As a result, students may need a higher overall score to remain in the same achievement level as the previous year. If the student took the English language arts and mathematics assessments in a prior year, the results on the Oregon Individual Student Report will allow you to look at the progress your student made over the course of multiple years toward becoming college and career ready.
