Understanding Scores

# Grade Eight Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade eight mathematics?

In grade eight, students take their understanding of unit rates and proportional relationships to a new level, connecting these concepts to points on a line and ultimately using them to solve linear equations that require them to apply algebraic reasoning as well as knowledge of the properties of operations. Students also expand their understanding of numbers beyond rational numbers to include numbers that are irrational—meaning that they cannot be written as a simple fraction, such as pi (or π).

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade eight [California academic standards](http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/index.asp) for mathematics and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and
Communicating Reasoning. These three claims are based on [California’s academic standards](http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/index.asp), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade eight.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
