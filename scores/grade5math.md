Understanding Scores

# Grade Five Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade five mathematics?

In grade five, students continue to build their understanding of the place value system by working with decimals up to the thousandths place. Students also add, subtract, and multiply fractions, including fractions with unlike denominators. They continue to expand their geometry and measurement skills, learning the concept of volume and measuring the volume of a solid figure.

## Overall Achievement

The student took the assessment based on the grade five [Oregon academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx) for mathematics and received an overall score.
This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at
different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

### Standard Level 4: 2579 or higher {#desc-exceeded}

The student has made progress and exceeded the grade five standard for mathematics. The student appears ready for future coursework.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures,
Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims (i.e., areas) are based on [Oregon's academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade five.

If the student did not receive a score for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive claim scores.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Level 4**, **Level 3 or 2**, or **Level 1** from the student-level selections available in the table below.

<div class="by-claim concepts">
	<div class="claim">
		<h3>Concepts and Procedures</h3>
		<p>The Concepts and Procedures claim (i.e., area) assesses the student’s understanding of key mathematical concepts and procedures and the student’s ability to apply these concepts and procedures to solve problems.</p>
