Understanding Scores

# Grade Six Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade six mathematics?

In grade six, students learn the concepts of rates and ratios and use these tools to solve word problems. They work on quickly and accurately dividing multi-digit whole numbers and adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing multi-digit decimals. Students extend their previous work with fractions and decimals to understand the concept of rational numbers—any number that can be made by dividing one integer by another, such as 1/2, –0.75, or 2. Students also learn how to write and solve numerical and algebraic equations—mathematical statements using variables, such as 20+x = 35—and apply these skills in solving multistep word problems.

## Overall Achievement

The student took the assessment based on the grade six [Oregon academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx) for mathematics and received an overall score. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims are based on [Oregon's academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade six.

If the student did not receive a score for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive claim scores.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Level 4**, **Level 3 or 2**, or **Level 1** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
