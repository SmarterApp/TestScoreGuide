Understanding Scores

# Grade Six Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade six mathematics?

In grade six, students learn the concepts of rates and ratios and use these tools to solve word problems. They work on quickly and accurately dividing multi-digit whole numbers and adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing multi-digit decimals. Students extend their previous work with fractions and decimals to understand the concept of rational numbers—any number that can be made by dividing one integer by another, such as 1/2, –0.75, or 2. Students also learn how to write and solve numerical and algebraic equations—mathematical statements using variables, such as 20+x = 35—and apply these skills in solving multistep word problems.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade six [Idaho Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/) for mathematics and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

### Standard Nearly Met (Level 2): 2473–2551  {#desc-nearly-met}

The student nearly met the grade six standard for mathematics needed for likely success in future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) ways to help the student improve.

</div>
<div class="accordion" markdown="1">

### Standard Not Met (Level 1): 2103–2472 {#desc-not-met}

The student did not meet the grade six standard for mathematics needed for likely success in future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) ways to help the student improve.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims are based on [Idaho's Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade six.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
