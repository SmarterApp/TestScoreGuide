Understanding Scores

# Grade Eleven Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade eleven mathematics?

In grade eleven, students develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and use mathematical ways of thinking to solve real-world problems. Unlike previous grades where learning objectives are organized by grade level, high school learning objectives are organized by conceptual categories—such as algebra, functions, or geometry—that students will learn in various mathematics courses. These categories build on what students learned in grade eight and move toward greater depth of knowledge and skills throughout high school.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade eleven [California academic standards](http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/index.asp) for mathematics and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

<div class="accordion" markdown="1">

### Standard Exceeded (Level 4): 2718–2862 {#desc-exceeded}

The student exceeded the grade eleven standard for mathematics and is ready for future coursework.

Early Assessment Program (EAP) Status: Ready for mathematics college-level coursework

Under the EAP—which is a collaboration of the California State University (CSU), participating California Community Colleges (CCCs), and the California Department of Education—the student’s California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress overall score indicates he or she is considered ready for mathematics college-level work. Review the information on the [CSU Success Web page](http://csusuccess.org/) to see how this status can help avoid the need for additional testing upon entering a CSU or CCC.

### Standard Met (Level 3): 2628–2717 {#desc-met}

The student met the grade eleven standard for mathematics and appears ready for future coursework.

Early Assessment Program (EAP) Status: Conditionally ready for mathematics college-level coursework

Under the EAP—which is a collaboration of the California State University (CSU), participating California Community Colleges (CCCs), and the California Department of Education—the student’s California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress overall score indicates he or she is considered conditionally ready for mathematics college-level work. Students earning a status of conditionally ready can be exempt from the CSU’s placement test and the Early Start Program by taking an approved senior year course and earning a grade of C or better. If the student earned a conditionally ready status, we encourage you to reach out to the administrators and teachers at the student’s school about enrolling the student in an approved senior year mathematics course. In addition, review the information on the [CSU Success Web page](http://csusuccess.org/) to see how this status can help avoid the need for additional testing upon entering a CSU or CCC.

### Standard Nearly Met (Level 2): 2543–2627  {#desc-nearly-met}

The student nearly met the grade eleven standard for mathematics needed for likely success in future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) steps to help the student improve.

Early Assessment Program (EAP) Status: Not yet demonstrating readiness for mathematics college-level coursework

Under the EAP—which is a collaboration of the California State University (CSU), participating California Community Colleges (CCCs), and the California Department of Education—the student’s California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress overall score indicates he or she is not yet demonstrating readiness for mathematics college-level coursework. Review the information on the [CSU Success Web page](http://csusuccess.org/) to see what the student needs to do to enroll in a CSU or CCC.

### Standard Not Met (Level 1): 2280–2542 {#desc-not-met}

The student did not meet the grade eleven standard for mathematics and did not demonstrate readiness for future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) steps to help the student improve.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims are based on [California’s academic standards](http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/index.asp), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade eleven.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claims/, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
