Understanding Student Scores

# Grade Four Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade four mathematics?

In grade four, students use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve word problems, including problems involving place value, measurement conversions, geometric measurement (i.e., angles), and geometric shapes. Students continue to develop their understanding of fractions—creating equal fractions, comparing the size of fractions, adding and subtracting fractions, and multiplying fractions by whole numbers. They also begin to develop an understanding of the relationship between fractions and decimals.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade four [California academic standards](http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/index.asp) for mathematics and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. 
This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at 
different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

### Standard Exceeded (Level 4): 2549–2659 {#desc-exceeded}

The student has made progress and exceeded the grade four standard for mathematics. The student appears ready for future coursework.

### Standard Nearly Met (Level 2): 2411–2484 {#desc-nearly-met}

The student nearly met the grade four standard for mathematics needed for likely success in future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) ways to help the student improve.

</div>
<div class="accordion" markdown="1">

### Standard Not Met (Level 1): 2204–2410 {#desc-not-met}

The student did not meet the grade four standard for mathematics needed for likely success in future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) ways to help the student improve.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures, 
Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims (i.e., areas) are based on [California’s academic standards](http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/index.asp), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade four. 

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
