# Grade Three English Language Arts/Literacy

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade three English language arts/literacy?

In grade three, students build important reading, writing, listening, and research skills. They think, talk, and write about what they read in a variety of articles, stories, and other texts. In their writing, students pay more attention to organizing information, developing main points, and supporting these points with facts, details, and definitions. They develop listening skills and participate in class discussions by sharing their ideas and building on the ideas of others.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade three [Washington learning standards](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/default.aspx) for English language arts/literacy and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English language arts/literacy:
Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry. These four claims (i.e., areas) are based on
[Washington's learning standards](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/default.aspx),
which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade three.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **At/Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
