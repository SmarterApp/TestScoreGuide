# High School Mathematics

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in high school mathematics?

In high school, students develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and use mathematical ways of thinking to solve real-world problems. Unlike previous grades where learning objectives are organized by grade level, high school learning objectives are organized by conceptual categories—such as algebra, functions, or geometry—that students will learn in various mathematics courses. These categories build on what students learned in grade eight and move toward greater depth of knowledge and skills throughout high school.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the high school [Washington learning standards](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/default.aspx)
 for mathematics and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to about 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

### Level 4: 2697–3085 {#desc-exceeded}

The student exceeded the high school standard for mathematics and is ready for future coursework.

Higher Education Placement Agreement (HEPA) Status: Likely ready for college-level mathematics coursework

Under the HEPA—which is a collaboration of Washington’s community and technical colleges, all public and most private four-year universities, and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction—the student’s mathematics score indicates he or she is on track to be  ready for college-level mathematics coursework. Review the information on the [Bridge to College web page](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/BridgetoCollege/) to see how this status, as well as mathematics course-work during their junior and senior year, can help the student upon enrolling in higher education within Washington State.

### Level 3: 2614–2696 {#desc-met}

The student met the high school standard for mathematics and appears ready for future coursework.

Higher Education Placement Agreement (HEPA) Status: Likely ready for college-level mathematics coursework

### Level 2: 2533–2613  {#desc-nearly-met}

The student nearly met the high school standard for mathematics needed for likely success in future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) steps to help the student improve.

Higher Education Placement Agreement (HEPA) Status: Not yet demonstrating readiness for college-level mathematics coursework

Under the HEPA—which is a collaboration of Washington’s community and technical colleges, all public and most private four-year universities, and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction—the student’s mathematics score indicates he or she is not yet considered ready for college-level mathematics coursework. Review the information on the [Bridge to College web page](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/BridgetoCollege/) about how a Bridge to College course can help during the student’s senior year.

Assessment Graduation Requirement Cut Score: In August 2015, the Washington State Board of Education set a minimum score of 2595 (which is within Level 2) for graduation. It remains a goal of the Board that all students will earn at least a Level 3 on the high school Smarter Balanced exams. As students and the system adjust to new standards and new assessments, the Board will revisit the minimum score that students need to graduate. If a high school student has not met the minimum score of 2595, they can retake the Smarter Balanced test, or use one of the other legislatively approved Assessment Graduation Alternatives.

### Level 1: 2118–2532 {#desc-not-met}

The student did not meet the high school standard for mathematics and did not demonstrate readiness for future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) steps to help the student improve.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the three claims (i.e., areas) that together make up mathematics: Concepts and Procedures, Problem Solving and Modeling/Data Analysis, and Communicating Reasoning. These three claims are based on [Washington's learning standards](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/default.aspx), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in high school.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claims/, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **At/Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
