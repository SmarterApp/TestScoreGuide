Understanding Scores

# Grade Ten English Language Arts/Literacy

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade ten English language arts/literacy?

In grade ten, students closely and critically read complex works of literature and informational texts. In writing and through class discussions, students interpret what they read and present analyses based on appropriate examples and evidence from the text. They assess the strength of an author’s or speaker’s points and assumptions based on evidence from the text. Additionally, students expand their literary and cultural knowledge by reading great classic and contemporary works representative of various time periods, cultures, and worldviews. High school students develop the skill, fluency, and concentration to produce high-quality writing, as well as the capacity to edit and improve their writing over multiple drafts.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade ten [Idaho Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/) for English language arts/literacy and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English language arts/literacy: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry.
These four claims are based on [Idaho's Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade ten.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
