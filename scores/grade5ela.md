Understanding Scores

# Grade Five English Language Arts

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade five English language arts?

In grade five, students continue to build important reading, writing, listening, and research skills. They read more challenging literature, articles, and other sources of information and continue to develop their vocabulary. Students are also expected to understand and clearly summarize what they have learned from readings and classroom discussions, referring to specific evidence and details from text. Students regularly write for different purposes, and continue to develop their ability to gather, organize, interpret, and present information.

## Overall Achievement

The student took the assessment based on the grade five [Oregon academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx) for English language arts and received an overall score. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English language arts: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research.These four claims (i.e., areas) are based on [Oregon's academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade five.

If the student did not receive a score for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive claim scores.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.

<div class="by-claim reading">
