# High School English Language Arts/Literacy

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in high school English language arts/literacy?

In high school, students closely and critically read complex works of literature and informational texts. In writing and through class discussions, students interpret what they read and present analyses based on appropriate examples and evidence from the text. They assess the strength of an author’s or speaker’s points and assumptions based on evidence from the text. Additionally, students expand their literary and cultural knowledge by reading great classic and contemporary works representative of various time periods, cultures, and worldviews. High school students develop the skill, fluency, and concentration to produce high-quality writing, as well as the capacity to edit and improve their writing over multiple drafts.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the high school [Washington learning standards](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/default.aspx) for English language arts/literacy and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to about 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

### Level 4: 2682–3032 {#desc-exceeded}

The student exceeded the high school standard for English language arts/literacy and is ready for future coursework.

Higher Ed Placement Agreement (HEPA) status: Ready for college-level English coursework

Under the HEPA—which is a collaboration of Washington’s community and technical colleges, all public and most private four-year universities, and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction—the student’s ELA score indicates he or she is considered ready for college-level English coursework. Review the information on the [Bridge to College web page](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/BridgetoCollege/) to see how this status can help avoid the need for placement testing upon enrolling in higher ed.

### Level 2: 2493–2582 {#desc-nearly-met}

The student nearly met the high school standard for English language arts/literacy needed for likely success in future coursework. Please discuss with the student’s teacher(s) steps to help the student improve.

Higher Ed Placement Agreement (HEPA) Status: Not yet demonstrating readiness for college-level English coursework

Under the HEPA—which is a collaboration of Washington’s community and technical colleges, all public and most private four-year universities, and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction—the student’s ELA score indicates he or she is not yet considered ready for college-level English coursework. Review the information on the [Bridge to College web page](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/BridgetoCollege/) about how a Bridge to College course can help.

Assessment Graduation Requirement Cut Score: In August 2015, the Washington State Board of Education set a minimum score of 2548 (which is within Level 2) for graduation. It remains a goal of the Board that all students will earn at least a Level 3 on the high school Smarter Balanced exams. As students and the system adjust to new standards and new assessments, the Board will revisit the minimum score that students need to graduate.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English language arts/literacy: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry.
These four claims are based on [Washington's learning standards](http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/default.aspx), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in high school.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **At/Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
