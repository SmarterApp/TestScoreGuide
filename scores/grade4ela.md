Understanding Scores

# Grade Four English Language Arts/Literacy

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade four English language arts/literacy?

In grade four, students continue to build important reading, writing, listening, and research skills. They read more challenging stories, plays, poems, articles, and other sources of information and continue to grow their vocabulary. They are also expected to clearly explain in detail what they have read by referring to details or information from the text. In writing, students may write stories, essays, reports, and persuasive papers, and learn to organize their ideas and develop topics with reasons, facts, details, and other information.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade four [Idaho Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/) for English language arts/literacy and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English language arts/literacy: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry. These four claims are based on [Idaho's Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade four.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
