Understanding Scores

# Grade Eight English Language Arts/Literacy

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade eight English language arts/literacy?

In grade eight, students read major works of fiction and nonfiction from all over the world and from different time periods. They continue to learn how to understand what they read and evaluate an author’s assumptions and claims. They also conduct research that will require the analysis of resources and accurate interpretation of literary and informational text. In their writing, they connect information and ideas efficiently and effectively.

## Overall Achievement

The student took a Smarter Balanced assessment based on the grade eight [Idaho Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/) for English language arts/literacy and received an overall score that ranges from about 2000 to 3000. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English language arts/literacy: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry. These four claims are based on [Idaho's Content Standards](http://sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade eight.

If the student received a score of “No Score Available” for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Above Standard**, **Near Standard**, or **Below Standard** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
