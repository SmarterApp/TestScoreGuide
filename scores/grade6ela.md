Understanding Scores

# Grade Six English Language Arts

## What are the knowledge and skills the student is expected to learn in grade six English language arts?

In grade six, students read a range of challenging books, articles, and texts and are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the material by answering questions and contributing to class discussions. In writing, students continue to work on their use of language, sentence structure, and organization of ideas. They are also expected to integrate information from different sources and respond to challenging content through written interpretation and analysis.

## Overall Achievement

The student took the assessment based on the grade six [Oregon academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx) for English language arts and received an overall score. This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here. Sample test items may be included that exemplify the kinds of passages and questions that students at different levels of achievement would likely answer correctly.

## Student Achievement by Claim

The student’s results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English language arts: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research. These four claims are based on [Oregon's academic content standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx), which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade six.

If the student did not receive a score for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive claim scores.

To view a description of the student’s achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either **Level 4**, **Level 3 or 2**, or **Level 1** from the student-level selections available in the table below.
