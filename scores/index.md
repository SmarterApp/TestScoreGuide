# Understanding Student Scores

The information on this page helps you understand the overall score and the corresponding achievement level, as well as the student’s strengths and weaknesses by claim (i.e., area). It is important to remember that these results are just one measure of the student’s learning and progress. To begin, select the student’s grade, test subject, and score range for the overall score that appears on the Oregon Individual Student Report from the drop-down menus, then select the **Go!** button.
