## What Is ISAT?

These computer-based tests, which students in grades three through eight and grade ten take each spring, were created to gauge each student’s performance as he or she develops—grade by grade—the skills he or she needs. Students can also take these tests in grades 9 and 11 at each district’s discretion.
