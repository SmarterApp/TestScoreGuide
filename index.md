## What Is WCAP?

Washington’s Comprehensive Assessment Program (WCAP) is a collection of assessments administered statewide. Smarter Balanced tests are the WCAP tests featured in this Score Guide. These computer-based tests, which students in grades three through eight and high school take each spring, were created to gauge each student’s performance as he or she develops—grade by grade—the skills he or she needs.
