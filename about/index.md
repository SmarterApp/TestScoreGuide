# What Is the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP)?

California’s new academic standards—what we want students to know and be able to do—are designed so students graduate ready for college and a career. These tests were created specifically to gauge each student’s performance in mathematics and English language arts/literacy as he or she develops—grade by grade—the skills called for by the standards, including the ability to write clearly, think critically, and solve problems. Teachers, business leaders, and public colleges and universities all support these long-term learning goals, because they reflect what students need to be prepared for the career and college experiences that await them. 


## Three Million Students, One Common Yardstick

Every school is different, and each takes its own approach to teaching, learning, and assessing student progress. Results of any test should be considered along with other measures of learning and in consultation with a student’s teachers. Because CAASPP tests are given statewide, they provide an opportunity to measure the skills of all students against the same academic standards in the same way, and the results provide information schools can use to improve teaching and learning. Given that the online tests are computer adaptive, the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments provide a more precise measurement of individual skills.
